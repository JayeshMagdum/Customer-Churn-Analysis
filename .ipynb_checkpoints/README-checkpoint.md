# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction (Telecom)

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical challenge for telecom companies. This project analyzes customer behavior data to identify key churn drivers and builds machine learning models to predict customers who are likely to churn.

The goal is to help businesses take proactive, data-driven actions to improve customer retention and reduce revenue loss.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest (Best Performing Model)

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- New customers show higher churn rates
- Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn
- High monthly charges increase churn risk
- Contract type and tenure are strong churn predictors

---

## 📊 Model Performance
- Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC Curve and AUC used to assess model effectiveness
- Random Forest achieved the best overall performance

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Target high-risk customers with personalized retention offers
- Encourage long-term contracts through incentives
- Protect high-value customers with proactive engagement
- Use churn prediction model for monthly risk scoring
